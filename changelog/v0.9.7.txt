- `keyutils_test.go` - Extended with encoding edge cases and zeroize testing
- `crypto_concurrent_test.go` - Expanded concurrent access testing
- `crypto_integration_workflows_test.go` - Fixed workflow test failures
- `crypto_boundary_test.go` - Added maximum input size and corrupted data testing
- `crypto_stress_test.go` - Added performance and stress testing scenarios
- README.md - Updated coverage percentage to 91.5%
- CI workflow - Added race detection with CGO enabled

## #Corrected
- Test duplicate declarations causing compilation errors
- Race condition in test execution (resolved by removing duplicates)
- Empty plaintext encryption support (previously rejected)
- Error handling for corrupted ciphertext detection
